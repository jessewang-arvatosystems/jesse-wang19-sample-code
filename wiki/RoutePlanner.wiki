#summary RoutePlanner is a web application that allows a client to find the shortest route(s) between two stations on the London Underground.

= Introduction =

RoutePlanner was completed with a team of nine people including me while training at the FDM Academy. I was responsible for wiring the classes with annotations, setting up the Spring Security, setting up Spring AOP and general code review.

  * The "shortest route" is the route that has the least number of stops and the least number of line transfers.
  * The user must register an account and login before being able to use the web application.
